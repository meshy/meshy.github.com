# LINKREASE

A real-time-strategy
game that started off as my Computer Science BSc dissertation project.
As a conquest game it is in the family of [FreeOrion](http://www.freeorion.org/),
[Eufloria](http://www.eufloria-game.com/), and [Galcon](http://www.galcon.com/fusion/).
It's written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using [Cocos2D](http://cocos2d.org/).

The [code for LINKREASE](http://github.com/meshy/linkrease) is on github.
It's mothballed at the moment, but I hope to come back to it some day.
