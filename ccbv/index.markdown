# Classy Class-Based Views (CCBV)

An open source reference tool for [Django](http://djangoproject.org)'s
class-based generic views that flattens the complex hierarchy of multiple
inheritance and displays the result in a linear and comprehensible manner.

To see it in action, go to [ccbv.co.uk](http://ccbv.co.uk/).
