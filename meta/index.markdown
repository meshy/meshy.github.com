# This website
A number of technologies collide to create this website:

- Each page is written in `Markdown`.
- The styles are written in `SASS` building upon [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) using the [`RSCSS`](https://github.com/rstacruz/rscss#readme) method.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) compiles the styles and pages into `HTML5` and `CSS`.
- [The code](http://github.com/meshy/meshy.github.com/) is stored on Github, and the rendered content is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).
- The [logo font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Aladin) is from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

Thanks to [George Hickman](http://ghickman.co.uk/) for introducing me to
Jekyll and giving me a helping hand as I got started.
