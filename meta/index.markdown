# This website
The layout of this website is written in HTML5, the content of each page is
written in Markdown, the [logo font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Aladin)
 is from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts), the styles are based on
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
it's hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com),
and the fantastic [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) knits everything together.

Would you like to [read the code](http://github.com/meshy/meshy.github.com/)?

Thanks to [George Hickman](http://ghickman.co.uk/) for introducing me to
Jekyll and giving me a helping hand as I got started.
