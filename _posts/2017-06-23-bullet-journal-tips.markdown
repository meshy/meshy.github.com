I've tried keeping a diary, and I've tried all sorts of life management apps,
but I've never managed to really stick with it. Then a colleague introduced me
to [Bullet Journal][bullet-journal]. It's turned out to be invaluable. I'm a
fan, even if I'm not using as prolifically now as I was when I started a little
over a year ago.

A few days ago, I was asked if I knew a good introduction guide. I don't
really. Rather than disappoint, I typed up some quick tips. As if to prove that
there's no rest for the wicked, I was encouraged to [write them down
publicly][write-more]. The particulars of the process are already covered very
well elsewhere, so, in lieu of anything coherent, here're a few disjointed
thoughts on the subject.

To start with, you can't go wrong with the "[How to Bullet Journal][how-to]"
video (~4 mins) from the project's main home page. It's a short video
explaining how the system works, and why you might want to give it a go.

If you pick it up, after a while, you might start looking for further
inspiration. There are a lot of great ideas on the [Bullet Journal blog][blog].
Scanning through the pictures will reveal a lot of (dauntingly artistic)
alternative layouts for the main "modules". Don't worry if you're not
super-artistic. There's a chance that might come with time, but I recommend
focussing on the routine and utility. You can always add flair later.

I like to keep a lot of lists in the book, and transfer them to the new book
once I've filled one up. I have lists for "movies/tv to watch", "books to
read", "games to play", "birthdays", and others. Recently, as I've made more of
an effort to cook, I've been recording [recipes I like][jambalaya] too.

As for the book you use, I highly recommend dotted grid-paper. I use the
large Moleskine hard-cover books, but the Leuchtturm 1917 books look pretty
nice too. The Leuchtturm books have slightly broader pages. They both ought to
be good for fountain-pen use, if that's your thing. It's my thing.

Finally, don't forget that it's your book. By this I mean: it doesn't matter if
you stray from the guidelines, tear out a few pages, and scribble all over the
others. Go nuts. Adapting, inventing you own way of doing things, and skipping
the things that get in your way is greatly encouraged.
