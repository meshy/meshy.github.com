# Hi, I'm Charlie Denton.

I work as senior developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com) in Oxford (UK).
I like to toy with shiny new stuff (recently redis, tornado and angular)
and primarily work with [django](http://djangoproject.com) in
[python](http://www.python.org/) on [linux](http://manjaro.org).


## CCBV

If you're a django developer, check out my reference tool for django,
[Classy Class-Based Views](http://ccbv.co.uk/). It flattens the new <i>class-based
generic views</i> to a page each, making it easy to read only the code you need to see.
Now with diagrams!
