# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton.

I'm a senior developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com) in Oxford (UK) who
recently graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in Computer Science.
I primarily work with [django](http://djangoproject.com) in python on linux but
have also been playing with redis, tornado and angular.

Also a django developer? Read about "[Classy Class-Based Views](/ccbv/)".
