# Hi, I'm Charlie Denton.

I'm a Senior Software Developer at [Virtualstock][virtualstock] in the UK.

In my spare time I like to toy with shiny new stuff (recently websockets, webpack, and ansible)
and primarily work with [Django][django] in [Python][python] on [Linux][manjaro].

## [FramewIRC][framewirc]

I couldn't find an `asyncio` IRC library to match my needs, so I wrote one myself! [FramewIRC][framewirc] (pronounced "framework") is simple and modular in the hopes of being a good starting point for others to write bots, bouncers, clients, and more specialised IRC libraries.


## [Python Wheels][pythonwheels]

Wheels are the fast new standard of python distribution. [Python Wheels][pythonwheels] offers a chance to learn about wheels and their use, and see at a glance how many projects already use them.

## [Classy Class-Based Views][ccbv]

Django's class-based generic views are great, but can be hard to grasp. The learning curve is made steep by a complex tree of multiple inheritance. [CCBV][ccbv] attempts to flatten the curve by allowing you to easily find and read the code you care about.
