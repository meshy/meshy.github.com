# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton,

I am a python programmer. I work with [django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
at [Incuna](http://incuna.com/). If you like django, you might like my
classy class-based-views reference tool [CCBV](http://ccbv.co.uk/).
I have a passion for linux, python and free (as in speech) software.

These are my (sparse) ramblings. Expect handy programming snippets, the occasional
rant, and [shameless self promotion](/projects/).
