# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton.

I'm a senior developer at [incuna](http://incuna.com) in Oxford (UK) who
recently graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in Computer Science.

I primarily work with [django](http://djangoproject.com) in python but
also enjoy playing with tornado, linux, and free (as in speech) software.

Also a django developer? Read about "[Classy Class-Based Views](/ccbv/)".
