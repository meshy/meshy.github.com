# Hi, I'm Charlie Denton.

I work as senior developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com) in Oxford (UK).
I like to toy with shiny new stuff (recently redis, tornado and angular)
and primarily work with [django](http://djangoproject.com) in
[python](http://www.python.org/) on [linux](http://manjaro.org).


## [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/)

Wheels are the fast new standard of python distribution. [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) offers a chance to learn about wheels and their use, and see at a glance how many projects already use them.

## [Classy Class-Based Views](http://ccbv.co.uk/)

Django's class-based generic views are great, but can be hard to grasp. The learning curve is made steep by a complex tree of multiple inheritance. [CCBV](http://ccbv.co.uk/) attempts to flatten the curve by allowing you to easily find and read the code you care about.
