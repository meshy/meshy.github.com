# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton,

I am a Developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com/), and one of the developers of
the django class-based views reference tool [CCBV](http://ccbv.co.uk/).
I do a lot of web development, have a passion for linux, python and free
(open-source) software. These are my sparse ramblings.

Expect handy little programming snippets, the occasional rant, and shameless
promotion of myself and [my projects](/projects/).
