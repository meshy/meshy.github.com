# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton,

I am a English python developer.
I work with [django](https://www.djangoproject.com) at [Incuna](http://incuna.com/).
I have a passion for linux, python, and free (as in speech) software.
If you like django, you might like my "classy class-based-views" reference tool, [CCBV](http://ccbv.co.uk/).
