# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton,

I am a Developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com/) and the Technical Director of [Gubha](http://gubha.com/). I do a lot of web development, have a passion for linux, python and free (open-source) software, and even make the [odd game](/projects/#linkrease) now and then. These are my ramblings.

I expect this website to fill up with lots of handy little programming snippets, the occasional rant, and shameless promotion of [myself](/me/) and [my projects](/projects/).
