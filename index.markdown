# Hi. I'm Charlie Denton,

I am a Developer at [Incuna](http://incuna.com/). I do a lot of web development, have a passion for linux, python and free (open-source) software. These are my ramblings.

Expect handy little programming snippets, the occasional rant, and shameless promotion of [myself](/me/) and [my projects](/projects/).
