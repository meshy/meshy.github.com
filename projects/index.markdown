# My projects

## LINKREASE

LINKREASE is a real-time-strategy game that started off as my Computer Science BSc dissertation project. As a conquest game it is in the family of [FreeOrion](http://www.freeorion.org/), [Eufloria](http://www.eufloria-game.com/), and [Galcon](http://www.galcon.com/fusion/). It's written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using [Cocos2D](http://cocos2d.org/).

## This website
The framework of this website is written in HTML5, the content of each page is written in Markdown, and the semi-magical [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is used to knit everything together. (Thanks go to [George Hickman](http://ghickman.co.uk/) for pointing me in the right direction on that one.)
