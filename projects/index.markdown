# My projects

## Classy Class-Based Views

An open source reference tool for [Django](http://djangoproject.org)'s
class-based generic views that flattens the complex hierarchy of multiple
inheritance and displays the result in a linear and comprehensible manner.

To see it in action, go to [ccbv.co.uk](http://ccbv.co.uk/).


## LINKREASE

[LINKREASE](http://github.com/meshy/linkrease) is a real-time-strategy
game that started off as my Computer Science BSc dissertation project.
As a conquest game it is in the family of [FreeOrion](http://www.freeorion.org/),
[Eufloria](http://www.eufloria-game.com/), and [Galcon](http://www.galcon.com/fusion/).
It's written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using [Cocos2D](http://cocos2d.org/).

## This website
The framework of this website is written in HTML5, the content of each page is
written in Markdown, and the semi-magical [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
is used to knit everything together. (Thanks to [Github](http://github.com/) for hosting
it, and [George Hickman](http://ghickman.co.uk/) for showing me how it all works.)
